The Point Of Sale device simulator allows retail software that uses JavaPOS APIs to run without the hassle of attaching hardware. The simulator is ideal for development and automated tests at workstations without the need for printers, scanners, line displays, etc.

Our simulated JavaPOS devices can be configured in your jpos.xml.  When created, the simulator provides an application window with tabs that represent each device.

The simulator currently contains implementations for the following JavaPOS devices:
  * Cash Drawer
  * POS Printer
  * Fiscal Printer
  * Line Display
  * MICR
  * MSR
  * Scanner
  * Signature Capture
